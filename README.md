ðŸ‘‹ Hi. I'm rather an amateur than a professional coder but I'm still learning.
My skills:
HTML 15%
CSS 10%
CPP 3% ðŸ™ƒ
Most of my projects are in English, but not all because eng isn't my native lang.
You can contact me via: (coming soon).
Also sorry for spelling mistakes.

Deerrorer/Deerrorer is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
